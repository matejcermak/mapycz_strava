# Mapy + Strava Heatmap Overlay

This repo includes:

- `mapy_strava_overlay.user.js` — Tampermonkey userscript that overlays
  Strava global heatmap (or Waymarked Trails MTB routes) on `mapy.com`
  while keeping all native Mapy controls
- `index.html` / `app.js` / `styles.css` — small standalone demo planner
  (not needed for the userscript flow)

## Real Mapy Overlay

### Setup

1. Install Tampermonkey in your browser.
2. Create a new userscript and paste `mapy_strava_overlay.user.js`.
3. Open `https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap` once **in a normal tab
   while logged in**, and pan/zoom once so heatmap tiles load. This makes Strava
   set the CloudFront signed cookies (scoped to `.strava.com`, ~1-week expiry)
   that gate the high-resolution `tiles-auth` tiles. Do this in a real tab, not
   just rely on the background refresh — third-party cookie partitioning can
   stop an iframe's cookies from being usable.
4. Open `https://mapy.com/` and pan/zoom — the overlay tracks the URL.

### Hotkeys

Two independent overlays — a **global** heatmap (`S`) and your **personal**
heatmap (`D`) — that can be shown together (personal blue on top of global hot).
Main controls are a left-hand cluster: **A S D F**.

- `A` — toggle the whole overlay on/off
- `S` — cycle the **global** heatmap (remembered across reloads):
  **MTB** (hot) → **Road** (hot) → **off**.
- `D` — toggle your **personal** heatmap on/off (blue). Its sport follows `S`
  (MTB global → MTB personal, Road global → Road personal); when global is off it
  uses the last bike sport you looked at.
- `F` — toggle Mapy base map between **aerial** (satellite) and **outdoor**
  (aerial shows best whether an MTB path is actually rideable).
- `E` — export current Mapy planner route as GPX and open Ride with GPS upload
- `[` / `]` — decrease / increase opacity in 10% steps
- `Alt + D` — toggle debug panel
- `P` — toggle Mapy panorama

Colors are **fixed**: global heatmaps are `hot`; personal is fetched as
`grayscale` (transparent where you have no activity) and **tinted blue via CSS**
(`PERSONAL_TINT_FILTER`) — requesting `color=blue` from the personal endpoint
returns opaque-black "empty" tiles (black boxes). No color hotkey. Waymarked
Trails route layers were removed.

### Tile sources

| Layer | URL pattern | Max zoom | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global per-sport heatmap (`S`) | `content-a.strava.com/identified/globalheat/sport_{MountainBikeRide,Ride}/hot/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?v=19&missing=empty` | ~15 | CloudFront **cookie** (logged-in `.strava.com`, via `GM_xmlhttpRequest`) |
| Personal heatmap (`D`) | `personal-heatmaps-external.strava.com/tiles/<athleteId>/blue/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?...&filter_type=sport_{MountainBikeRide,Ride}&...` | ~15 | CloudFront **cookie** |

The **global per-sport heatmap** is the endpoint the Strava web app itself uses,
and — unlike the public `heatmap-external/.../ride/...` tiles — it **separates
disciplines** (`sport_Ride` = road, `sport_MountainBikeRide`). It authenticates by
cookie, fetched through Tampermonkey (`@connect content-*.strava.com` +
`strava.com`, `withCredentials`) so the browser attaches your `.strava.com`
cookies. No query-string signature or capture step is involved.

### Personal heatmap setup

The personal heatmap tile URL contains your **athlete id**, so it's baked into
`PERSONAL_HEAT_URL_TEMPLATE` near the top of the script (currently Matěj's,
`4568015`). To use a different account, open your personal heatmap on Strava
(`https://www.strava.com/maps/personal-heatmap`, logged in), grab a tile URL from
DevTools → Network, and swap the athlete id / template in. Placeholders `{z}`
`{x}` `{y}` `{sport}` `{color}` are substituted at render time (`{sport}` =
`sport_MountainBikeRide` / `sport_Ride`, `{color}` = `blue`).

### Caching & performance

Tiles are cached so panning/switching/reopening is fast instead of re-fetching
every tile through the (rate-limited) cookie path:

- **In-memory** object-URL cache (this session) — switching `S`/`D` or panning
  back is instant.
- **IndexedDB** cache for **global** tiles (`mapyStravaTileCache`, 30-day TTL) —
  re-opening mapy renders cached areas immediately, no network. This is lazy
  "pre-download": whatever you look at is cached and stays fast. Personal tiles
  are **not** persisted (they change often) — memory-only for the session.
- **Stale-request abort** — when a render is superseded (you panned or toggled),
  its in-flight tile requests are cancelled so they stop clogging the request
  pool, which is what made old tiles keep trickling in.

Global heat barely changes, so the 30-day TTL is fine; bump
`GLOBAL_TILE_TTL_MS` to refresh more/less often. (A full bulk "download all of
Czechia" prefetch is intentionally avoided — at useful zoom it's thousands of
tiles per sport; the lazy IndexedDB cache gives the same instant feel for the
areas you actually browse.)

### Auth — it just needs your logged-in Strava cookies

Open the heatmap once in a normal tab while logged in (`https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap`)
so Strava sets the CloudFront cookies, then use mapy. If heatmap tiles come back
`403`, your cookies are missing/expired — reload the Strava heatmap page (logged
in) to refresh them. Diagnose with `Alt+D`: the `gm ok/fail` and `last=` lines
show the tile HTTP status (`200` = working, `403` = cookie problem). High-res
(z>11) heatmap needs a Strava **subscription**; a free login is capped at z11.

> Legacy: an older path used `heatmap-external-*.strava.com/tiles{,-auth}` with a
> signed-query capture + cookie probe (`tryRefreshStravaAuth`,
> `probeStravaCookieAuth`). That endpoint returned `InvalidKey` for this account,
> so the script moved to the `content-*` per-sport endpoint above. The legacy
> code remains but isn't wired into the active source list.

**Diagnose:** press `Alt+D` and read the `gm ok/fail` and `last=` lines —
`200` means heatmap tiles are flowing, `403` means a cookie problem (reload the
Strava heatmap page logged in to refresh the CloudFront cookies).

### MTB vs road: actually split

The Strava per-sport heatmap *can* be split by discipline. The web app's
`content-*.strava.com/identified/globalheat/sport_<X>/...` endpoint serves
per-discipline heat — `sport_Ride` (road) vs `sport_MountainBikeRide` — which the
public `heatmap-external/.../ride/...` tiles do not (those aggregate every ride
sub-type into `ride`). `S` cycles MTB → Road → off, and the personal layer (`D`)
follows the same discipline. This needs your logged-in Strava cookies (and a
subscription for z>11); the official Strava API / MCP can't help — the heatmap is
an internal tile service outside the public API.

## Demo app

For local experimentation only:

- `python -m http.server 5500`
- Open `http://localhost:5500`
